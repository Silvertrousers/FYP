\section{Tasks}\label{sec:MVPProjectTasks}
\begin{enumerate} 
  \item Design and implement a software rasterizer (SWR) to use for bench-marking and testing

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Needs to implement the entire graphics pipeline
    \item Rasterization part of the pipeline should be implemented as a function with the same interface as the instruction I am planning to implement.
  \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Make the SWR openGL compliant with the spec of my instruction
    \item Cross compile the SWR to RISC-V
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Select a RISC-V tool-chain, the tool-chain used may be affected by the CPU core being used and which tools it comes with
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Decide on CPU core being used
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If I use BOOM or Rocket I will need to account for time needed to learn Chisel
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item System Design
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item System Architecture design 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Memory system, location of registers, where does the rasterizer fit in the CPU pipeline?
        \end{enumerate}
        
        \item Design of the rasterizer subsystem
        \item Modify RISC-V core to implement hardware for new instruction
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Modify decode unit
            \item If an OOO Core is used will need to modify register renaming system and other systems
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Micro-architectural design
        \item Implementation in RTL/Chisel
        \item RTL simulation
        \item Unit level testing and subsystem testing
        \item FPGA implementation
        \item Top level testing
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Implement benchmark with new instruction and run on system
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item Verification
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Likely do directed testing, maybe do constrained random if time? 
        \item Each level of testing should have a well thought out test plan
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Evaluation
    \item Further modification/optimisation of Design based on evaluation
        
\end{enumerate}

Green rows represent project deliverables. The system design task is also broken down into sub-tasks each of which have their own assigned due date.}

The plan is to write the report as I go. This is why there is very little time between finishing evaluation and the deadline for the first draft of the final report.
