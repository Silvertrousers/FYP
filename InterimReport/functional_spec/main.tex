%Will likely have very similar stuff to the OpenGL section
\section{Introduction}
The design philosophy of the project will be to do it from scratch using as few reference designs as possible. rasterization units have been designed since the 80's so this project should be more about trying to come up with a creative solution rather than a performant one, since obviously I will not be able to design a rasterizer unit that is more powerful than  a commercial one or even one developed by an entire research team.

This philosophy also informs my evaluation process, where as long as it works I can consider the project a success and if it performs better than a CPU alone great and if it is better than a comparable GPU, even better.
